# Project Highlights

## End-to-End Insight Engine
- **From raw text to knowledge graph** – Automates the full journey: ingest CSVs, parse graph pickles, deduplicate innovations, and produce a consolidated knowledge graph ready for downstream analytics or product features.
- **Adaptive clustering** – Offers both embedding-driven (HDBSCAN, K-Means, Agglomerative, Spectral) and graph-native (threshold, k-core) clustering strategies to fit different data characteristics without rewriting code.
- **Context-preserving consolidation** – Merged innovations retain aliases, source excerpts, and provenance, enabling rich storytelling and auditability.

## Analytics & Reporting Powerhouse
- **Turnkey visual analytics** – Generates Tufte-inspired plots, 3D/2D network visualisations, and top-organisation rankings, all exportable to stakeholders with zero manual charting.
- **Reusable exporter pipeline** – Exports canonical mappings, consolidated graphs, and metric snapshots in JSON/PNG/HTML, making it easy to plug into BI dashboards or presentations.
- **Built-in semantic search** – The new query engine embeds the consolidated graph so you can retrieve the most relevant innovations and their organisations with a single query.
- **Evaluation-first mindset** – Built-in precision/recall, consistency checks, and QA sampling provide tangible quality metrics for every run.

## Developer & Ops Excellence
- **Modern `src/` package layout** – Clear namespace (`innovation_platform`) makes imports reliable, encourages modular design, and eases packaging/deployment as a service.
- **Cache-aware embeddings** – Persisted Azure embeddings drastically reduce API spend and latency in iterative scenarios, supporting rapid experimentation.
- **Streamlit companion interface** – Delivers an interactive UI with chatbot-based search, network exploration, and KPI dashboards—ideal for demos, exec reviews, or analyst workflows.
- **Automated pipeline runner** – A single command (`python -m innovation_platform.pipeline_runner`) orchestrates data loading through query warm-up, resuming intelligently when artefacts are already available.

## Growth Potential
- **Future-ready architecture** – The modular data pipeline and CLI design leave room for real-time APIs, REST/GraphQL endpoints, or integration with workflow orchestrators.
- **Advanced method sandbox** – Easy to prototype GNNs, transformer-based entity matching, or heuristic + ML hybrids by swapping feature builders or clustering strategies.
- **Enterprise deployment ready** – Docker packaging, cloud export hooks, and forthcoming QA guardrails make the project a strong candidate for production rollout.
